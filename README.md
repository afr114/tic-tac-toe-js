# Tic-Tac-Toe-JS

#### By _**Abdul Rahimi**_

### Description

I initially worked on this project in September 2015 during a coding bootcamp with antonio97b(I forked this repo from him). 
I had promised myself I would circle back around and conquer this project, since I found it pretty difficult in 2015.  
I rewrote all of the javascript code from scratch and updated the styling.  The gameplay currently allows only two players to play.
There is no computer opponent yet.

Next Steps:  _1) Add a computer opponent._ 
             _2) Add a Service Worker to allow gameplay when not connected to network._

## Setup

* _Clone repository_
* _Open index.html in the browser of your choice_

## Technologies Used

_Written with JavaScript, mocha, chai, jQuery._
